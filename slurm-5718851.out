Effective Physical Core Utilization: 1.3% (0.452 out of 36)
 | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor physical CPU cores
 | utilization caused by:
 |     - load imbalance
 |     - threading runtime overhead
 |     - contended synchronization
 |     - thread/process underutilization
 |     - incorrect affinity that utilizes logical cores instead of physical
 |       cores
 | Explore sub-metrics to estimate the efficiency of MPI and OpenMP parallelism

    Effective Logical Core Utilization: 0.7% (0.492 out of 72)
     | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor logical CPU cores
